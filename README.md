# sfokth

sfokth is an R package aimed at bibliometric analysis of SFO:s (strategiska forskingsomr√•den) at KTH. Since access to the KTH bibliometric database is required, it is unlikely to be useful for anyone outside the KTH Library.

## Installation

Either fetch this repository and install from directory (easy in for example RStudio) or run
```R
remotes::install_github("KTH-Library/sfokth")
```
